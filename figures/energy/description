The folder 'rv' contains plots for the results of the regressors where the random variables have not yet been removed from the dataset;
the folder 'norv' contains plots for the dataset with random variables removed.
The third variant, 'nopp' contains plots for the results of regressors as used without pre-processing (normalization and scaling).
And in the folder 'fs' are the plots for results where feature selection has been applied (without random variables but with preprocessing).

the files are named after the regressor and the chosen secondary regressor parameters.
the primary regressor parameters have been used as X axis in the plots.
